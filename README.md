# ATM Script
This repository is used for the third assignment for the class IT-140-Q3788 Introduction to Scripting 18EW3 at Southern New Hampshire University. The task for this project is to create a very simple ATM. This third artifact addresses developing functions and using regular expressions to search for patterns.
The task is broken down into three sections:
* Collect customer input
* Calculate the ending balance
* Display the results to the customer

## Overview:
For your final project, you will be creating four small scripts. Collectively, the four scripts will demonstrate your ability to engage in the fundamental scripting and problem-solving approaches that are represented by the course outcomes.
Reminder: This the first draft. Even if your script is not functioning perfectly, submit your draft and get feedback so that you can improve on it for the final submission in Module Five.

## Prompt:
A function is a named series of statements. Invoking a function's name, known as a function call, causes the function's statements to execute. Python comes with a number of built-in functions, such as `input()`, `int()`, `type()`, and others. A programmer can also create a new function using the `def` keyword, the new function's name, and a block of statements. A block is a series of indented statements following the function definition.
To call a function, use the function's name followed by braces `function_name()`. This causes execution to jump to the function's statements. The function's return causes execution to jump back to where the original call occurred, to the next statement after the call. A good practice is to follow the convention of naming functions with lowercase letters and underscores, such as `print_names` or `print_face`.
Your task for this project is to create a simple ATM script. The script emphasizes the importance of using functions in the creation of more organized and reusable code.
You will be working on this project in the Project Three: ATM Script module in Codio on this project. Following the directions in that module, you will also be able to determine the exact placement of the comments you will need to make in the code. Follow the directions in the module in Codio to walk through the activity.

Specifically, the script should address the following critical elements:
* In Your Script (Annotated Text File) Refer to the directions in the module in Codio for how to export out and comment your completed script.
    * Identify examples of **custom functions** in your script using comments in your code.
    * Identify examples of **input(parameters)** that are utilized within the **function(s)** in your script using comments in your code.
    * Identify examples of functions that return the correct output in your script using comments in your code.

## Reminder: 
The following critical element is not submitted with your draft, but you should be sure to consider the elements of your reflection that you will submit with your finalized script in Module Five.

* Applying Your Experience - Making mistakes when you learn to write code is common. It is part of learning. What is important is developing the skill of learning how to understand your errors and then fix them (debugging). For this part of your final project, you will respond to the following:
    * Reflecting on your experience with this activity, explain the importance of knowing how and when to use and modify variables, and using branches. Support your response with examples from the activity of the types of errors and your method for fixing them.

## Rubric
### Guidelines for Submission: 
This is a draft of part of the final project. Complete the steps in Codio. Feedback will be provided by your instructor to incorporate in the final submission and the reflection document.

### Custom Functions
Identifies examples of custom functions in your script using comments in your code
### Input (Parameters) Function(s)
Identifies examples of input (parameters) that are utilized within the function(s) in your script using comments in your code
### Functions That Return Correct Output
Identifies examples of functions that return the correct output in your script using comments in your code
### Script Comments
Code comments explain and facilitate navigation of the code
